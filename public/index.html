        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Washington, eager to make my mark in the tech world. During my studies, I honed my skills in systems, and gained practical experience through the various projects.</p>
    
    <p>I'm passionate about distributed systems and systems in general, and I'm always excited to tackle new challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible with code. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing games as I am currently enjoying elden ring.</p>
    
    <p>I'm looking forward to contributing my fresh perspective and enthusiasm to innovative projects in the tech industry. Let's connect and explore how we can create something amazing together!</p>

                <br> 
                Designed and implemented a fault-tolerant distributed system using the Paxos consensus algorithm, ensuring consistency and replication across multiple nodes
Developed code in Java to handle each phase of the algorithm and implemented communication protocols for nodes to reach a consensus
Authored a comprehensive design document detailing the Paxos consensus algorithm, encompassing all associated states and high-level information to guide system-wide integration and optimization
</li>
            <li><strong>NFL Fantasy Picker</strong> 
                <br>
                Developed a real-time Full Stack application using React and Node.js, dynamically predicting the top ten starting players and updating scores based on real-time data.
Constructed and maintained an SQL database housing comprehensive data on 50 NFL players, ensuring timely score updates and data integrity.
</li>
            <li><strong>Comparing Paxos to Raft </strong> <br> 
                Explaining how to implement Paxos and Raft and the trade offs between the two of them and simulating using them for a sample workload to see how they operate</li>
